# React TypeScript CRUD

This repository contains a React application built with TypeScript that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project is designed to showcase a robust front-end solution for managing data using React and TypeScript, integrating well with a backend service.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Fully functional Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing data.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Utilizes TypeScript for type safety and enhanced developer experience.
- **React Components**: Modular and reusable React components for building the user interface.
- **State Management**: Manages application state effectively using React's Context API or a state management library like Redux.
- **API Integration**: Connects with a backend API to perform data operations and handle responses.
- **Form Handling**: Includes forms with validation for adding and updating records.
- **Data Display**: Dynamic display of data in tables or lists with sorting and pagination features.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the application is usable across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **React Router**: Declarative routing for React.js applications.
- **CSS/SCSS**: For styling the application with responsive design.
